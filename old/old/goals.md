# Research Goals

In this era of software systems that seem to grow ever more complex, it is wise to ask "is that complexity really needed?".

I think, to a large extent, it is not. The clue here is that, many times, it has been reported that [seemingly complex systems can be modeled and summarized to a much simpler structures](http://menzies.us/pdf/07strange.pdf).

Why is that so? What if their exists certain constraints that simplifies exploration of the world? And we can exploit those contrainst so simplify complex tasks? For example:

+ building algorithms for [better privacy](http://menzies.us/pdf/15lace2.pdf);
+ optimizing complex models, [faster](http://menzies.us/pdf/15gale.pdf);
+ moving lessons learned from [one project to another](http://menzies.us/pdf/13transferEffort.pdf);
+ explain seemingly complex effects, [very succinctly](http://menzies.us/pdf/07strange.pdf).
