Don't worry about people stealing an idea. If it's original, you will have to ram it down their throats.

-- [Howard Aiken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken)

Lessig and company have taught me that content's
value can lie in what it spawns and inspires. Locked
away, unseen, unused, not discussed, not linked, it
might as well not exist.

...

And Aaron Swartz has taught me that content must not
be the end game for knowledge. ...  Not using
knowledge is an offense to it. If it cannot fly free
beyond the confines of content, knowledge cannot
reach its full value through collaboration,
correction, inspiration, and use.

<p>Iâ€™m not saying that content wants to be free. I am asking whether knowledge wants to be content.
