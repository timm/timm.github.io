<h3>About Applying</h3>
<p>American universities accept new graduate students for start-of-study in mid-August and mid-January.
<p>The application process for those dates starts <em>months</em> in advance. You should be planning your
application at least one year before your desired start date.
<p> I have no authority to
accept students but, once they are accepted, I can supervise graduate students. So
please review our admissions procedures at our departmental Web site.</p>
<p> That said, during the admissions review process, all faculty are sent a sheet listing
the candidate students and I am allowed to "nudge" a handful of names. So if you elect to enroll here then please ping me so I can watch for your application in the system.</p>

<h3>Working with me</h3>
<p> As to me supervising you, I do not take on students until they have completed one of my grad subjects. This lets
us check each other out before we commit too much to each other.
<p> As to funding, I do not guarantee that my supervised students get funding from me.
  Funding comes and goes depending on the whims of the funding agencies and my policy is
  to fund my long-term Ph.D. students before anyone else.
  <ul>
    <li>That said, for your information, over the last decade,  75% of my  students were fully funded.</li>
    </ul>
</ul></p>

  <h3>Tips for writing to Professors</h3>

<p>When writing to a CS prof in the USA, here is some advice on how to attract their
  attention.

  <p>Do not send a form letter-- we get enough of those.</p>
    <p>To prove that you are not sending a form letter, best to make some reference to their current research, perhaps even to one of their recent papers (and
      how your prior work or interests match up).</p>
    <p>Demonstrate that you have done a little homework before sending and email about the department.
      E.g. <ul><li>
	read over the department's recruitment policies and say things like "I am targeting
	an application for your next round of applications for (say) January 2016 which I will
	submit to &lt;insert correct email name or web page reference here>".
      </ul>
      </p>
