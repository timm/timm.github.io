Notes on Industrial Collaboration

     <div class="row gutters">

      <div class="column-15">

	<p>I have had much experience with
	collaboration between university and
	  industrial/government organizations.</p>
	<p>In all
	cases, the key to success was to take the
	time to learn the needs and social
	  structures of the organizations.</p>
	<p>For examples of this process, see below.</p>
	
	<h3>Verification of industrial processes</h3>
	
	<img class="blackimg" align=right src="img/lexisnexis.png">
	<p>I am exploring, with an
           industrial partner (LexisNexis) issues
           related to the cost-effective exploration
           and deployment of models generated by
           data miners for Big Data applications.</p>
        <p>This new lab, called “SeBig” (Software
           Engineering for Big Data) focuses on
           the validation of Big Data inference in
          industrial applications.</p>
	<p>Initially,
           we are  explore the certification and
           possible improvement of text mining
           methods for legal
           applications. Subsequent work will be
           adapted, according to earlier results.
           Research is conducted in an agile
           manner with a backlog of industrial-based
           problems being explored by graduate
           students in monthly sprints, monitored by
           faculty with daily scrums.

	<h3>STTR: Small Business Technology Transfer 	</h3>
	
	<img class="blackimg" align=right src="img/gtech.png">
	<p>With Grammatech, I have previously proposed, developed, won, and
	  completed,  a $750,000  stage II Dod SBIR/STTR.</p>

	<h3>Research management	</h3>
	
	<img class="blackimg" align=right src="img/nasa.png">
	<p>I worked for four years inside the firewalls of
	  the NASA Software Assurance research program. There, I
	  was a technical consultant to NASA civil servant as they decided
	  how to allocated millions of dollars in research dollars
	  to research centers.	</p><br clear=all>
	
	<h3> Research programmers/ interns</h3>

	<p>In many cases, I have managed teams of graduate students
	  performing programming tasks for industrial clients.</p>
	<p>Two approaches for this are:
	  <ul>	<img class="blackimg" align=right src="img/jpl.gif">
	    <li><em>Term projects:</em> During term time, my students often
	      develop tools that implement cutting-edge algorithms
	      for industrial clients. For example, for the Jet Propulsion
	      Laboratory, my programmers have developed state-of-the-art
	      effort estimation tools.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Summer interns:</em>  many of my students spend their
	      summer working for industrial clients. When requested,
	      I assist/guide in the management of those students
	    (site visits, regular teleconfs).</li>
	</ul></p><br clear=all>
