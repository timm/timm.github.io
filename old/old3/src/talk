Let's Talk About... Stuff

<p>I've sent you this URL since you have asked to meet with me to tallk about stuff.
Sorry for the canned reply but, as you might imagine, I get lots of such queries.

<p>Now before we go any further, we need to understand <em>why</em> you want to talk to me:

<ol>
<li> Your are CONFUSED or PUZZLED about some aspect of life at NCSU and you need to vent on someone.
Sure, we can do that. I have coffee. I have a couch. Come visit and scream at me about what's bothering
you.

<li> You are a SURFER? i.e. you hang out sometimes in my lab (<a href="http://ai4se.net/">RAISE</a>: Real AI for SE).
Sure--  we can have fun, no pressure.

<li> You want to be a PROGRAMMER at <a href="http://ai4se.net/">RAISE</a>:. I.e. you have programming assignments in my lab, supporting my phd students. I don't pay you but you get experience with cool things. and no pressure. If things go all right, I can give you a reference or maybe guide you to a  publication. Or not.  Whatever. Like I said, no pressure.

<lI>
You want to be a SUPERVISED Ph.D. graduate student 
at <a href="http://ai4se.net/">RAISE</a>: As per 3 but you did such cool things in (3) that now I become your supervisor. Pressure now starts getting applied to get results, write papers. But you fund yourself via TAs or some other method
that is nothing to do with me.

<lI> You want to be a  GRA at at <a href="http://ai4se.net/">RAISE</a>: As per 4 but you did such cool things in (4) that now I fund you from grants. Pressure is on to get deliverables out. Also, you will often have to work off your thesis topic to cover tasks that are needed to keep the lab grants going.
</oL>
<p>Some other things to bear in mind:
<ol>
<li>
Note that you should have  <b>no</b> default expectation that (2) always  leads to (3) leads to (4) to (5)...
<li>
So how do you want us to work together? SURFER, PROGRAMMER, SUPERVISED? note that thre are no GRA positions open at this time. In fact, I have no spare grant money at this time-- won't have any till spring. 
And that's a maybe. 
<li>
Also, when new $$$ comes in, my first thing is to ensure my long-standing students are covered. So if any shortfalls, the newcomers are the first to move off salary.
</ol>
