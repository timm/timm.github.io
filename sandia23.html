<h1> Ideas for Sandia</h1>

<p>From <a href="http://menzies.us">Prof. Tim Menzies</a>, IEEE Fellow, full professor, NC State, computer sceince, timm@ieee.org.
<ul>
	Tim Menzies (IEEE Fellow, Ph.D., UNSW, 1995) is a full Professor in CS at North Carolina State University where he teaches software engineering, automated software engineering, and foundations of software science. He is the directory of the RAISE lab (real world AI for SE) and the author of over 280 publications (refereed). In his career, he has supervised 20 Ph.D. students, and has been a lead researcher on projects for NSF, NIJ, DoD, NASA, USDA (total funding of $13+ million) as well as joint research work with private companies.
	<p>Prof. Menzies is the editor-in-chief of the Automated Software Engineering journal and associate editor of TSE (IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering) and other leading SE journals.

<h2> Computing and Information Sciences (CIS) </h2>
<p>The Computing and Information Sciences Research Foundation (CIS RF) advances research and  development in computing, mathematics, and information sciences to position Sandia at the frontiers  and intersection of science, engineering, and national security.  
CIS Research Focus Areas include: 
<ul><li> Trusted Artificial Intelligence <b>Please see my work on <a href="http://menzies.us/pdf/Defeating _malicious_explanations.pdf">defeating malicious explanations</a>. There
			are many extensions that could follow from that-- the
			most pressing being to apply the ideas to much higher dimensional data.</b>
		<li> Computational Decision Science 
			<li> Information Science and Technology 
				<li> Quantum Information Sciences 
<li> Human-Machine Teaming to Enable Decision Making
	<b>Please see my work on "stakeholder testing" with the premise
		that that kind of analysis has to work at a much
		higher level that standard software testing. For that
		work I am exploring semi-supervised multi-objective
		explanation algorithms</b> </ul></p>



Cyber Innovation (CYBER)  
The CYBER focus area applies science and engineering principles to understand and enhance the secure  operation of complex, high-consequence national security systems in adversarial environments. We  seek innovative proposals to address all aspects of the systems stack including hardware, software,  complex systems, and data with an emphasis in the following areas:
<ul><li> Software Systems Understanding: Assurance and vulnerability research of software system  purpose, capability, flaws, communication and data processing and storage. Techniques that  advance static or dynamic analyses are encouraged. 


New Ideas (NI) 
• Fundamental research in fields of current interest to Sandia that are outside the strategy space  of the other Investment Areas (IAs)
