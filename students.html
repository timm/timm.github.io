<p>Because software mediates and controls nearly all aspects of our lives:</p>
<ul>
<li>It controls our stock markets and the pacemakers that control the beating of our hearts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because software is everyware.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live in London or New York and need to call an ambulance, that ambulance is waiting for your call at a location pre-determined by software.</li>
<li>If you cross from Mexico to Arizona, a biometrics model decides if you need secondary screening.</li>
<li>The power to make your toast comes from a generator that was spun-up in response to some software model predicting your future electrical demands.</li>
<li>If you fly a plane, extensive model-based software controls many aspects of flight, including what to do in emergency situations.</li>
<li>If you have a heart attack, the models in the defibrillator will decide how to shock your heart and lungs so that you might live a little longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software is a central tool in scientific research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many fields of science including physics, biology and other fields of science are becoming increasingly dependent on complex simulations using supercomputers.</li>
<li>Recent work constructing a computerized genomic map required analyzing some 80 trillion bytes of data. Other complex computational modeling projects include the rise and fall of native cultures, subnuclear particles and the Big Bang.</li>
<li>As a result, computational methods are now central to Nobel prize winning research. For example, Karplus and Levitt won the 2013 Nobel prize in chemistry for &quot;the development of multi-scale models for complex chemical systems&quot;. Their work in the 1970s is now central to moderns efforts to explore complex chemical reactions (e.g. split-second molecular changes occurring during photosynthesis).</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you can have an amazing career as a software engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software engineers are the builders of our digital world. They create everything from our computers' operating systems to the apps on our smartphones.</li>
<li>Software engineers are in high demand.
<ul>
<li>Rapid growth in consumer and industrial product development, which employs the greatest numbers of embedded software engineer and firmware engineer professionals, should result in very favorable opportunities for experienced individuals.</li>
<li>All indicators point to continuing strong demand for software engineers that are keeping their skills current with the latest technology.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate for this career is consistently below the national average.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Skilled coders are well paid and rarely have trouble finding work. This is a flexible field that allows individuals to work as freelancers or private consultants and diverse enough to accommodate those who work better by themselves or in a large group.</li>

<p>Because the next big thing is smart software.</p>
<p>Because older ideas like big data are dead. Or, to be more accurate, they are passe.</p>
<ul>
<li>When everyone can do something, then no one doing that is especially employable anymore.</li>
<li>Now that the systems issues of Big Data are sorted and everyone can access all that CPU and RAM and disk space, the next challenge will be to how to use all those resources.</li>
<li>And by &quot;use&quot; I mean, do stuff that is relevant to business users.</li>
<li>It turns out that the current generation of data miners all have biases- they all generate particular kinds of outputs (e.g. linear equations) that satisfy certain kinds of goals (e.g. minimize error predicted and actual).</li>
<li>Now speaking as someone who has worked, a lot, with business users I assert that the goals they wish to achieve are many and varied.</li>
<li>Hence, the next generation of analysis tools had better know how to adjust their biases in order to satisfy the next quirky request of the next business users.</li>
<li>Enter SE + AE.
<ul>
<li>The algorithms used here all accept a search bias as part of the specification of the input. That is, these tools are natural methods for handling all manner of user demands.</li>
<li>So, one reason to study SE + AI is to be ready for the next generation of the next big thing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Because SE + AI is soooo cool.</p>
<ul>
<li>These kinds of algorithms explore (and sometimes combines) multiple randomly selected solutions to a program. Such evolutionary methods are very cool indeed.</li>
<li>In 2011, the website Edge.org asked noted scientists the following question: <em>What is your favorite deep, elegant, or beautiful explanation?</em> They received dozens of answers and fully a third of those responses related to evolution and natural selection. The reason was clear- in terms of requiring the least machinery and explaining the most observations, hands down, evolution is the theory of the last 200 years.</li>
<li>What you get with this simple approach is quite a lot. With this kind of computation, you get:
<ul>
<li>Simple implementation: lots and lots of small devices;</li>
<li>Easy, coarse-grain co-ordination of effort;</li>
<li>Distributed computation, which can be parallelized;</li>
<li>Robust networks: that can survive attack and insult and death of some large percent of the network;</li>
<li>Adaptability and the generation of new ideas that have not been explored before;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What else offers so much from so little? So one reason to explore SE+AI is that it an explanation of an powerful engineering principle that has had (and will continue to have) a massive impact on this planet.</p>
